# CSI3450Project
VideoGameDB

!!!INITIALIZATION STEP!!!   
Before starting our database program, make sure you have the mySQL Workbench 8.0 CE local server created. To do this, make a server and an account with the following credentials:
Hostname: localhost  
Port: 3306  
Username: appProg  
Password: root  
Make sure to run the two provided .sql files, ERDCreationScript.sql and ERDInitializationScript.sql from our GitHub on this local server in order for the application to operate correctly.  
Once the server is set up and the query files are ran, open our program through one of the following methods:  

-> .exe method: From the main folder on the GitHub repository, navigate to VideoGameDB_UI/VideoGameDB_UI/bin/Release and then double click on the VideoGameDB_UI.exe file.

-> Through Visual Studio 2019:  Launch the .sln file included in our code from GitHub. This should lead you to the code. Press the green play button at the top of the window in order to execute our application.


!!!FOLDER FORMAT!!!  
If downloaded directly from GitHub, everything should be contained in a folder named “CSI3450Project-main”.   
CSI3450Project-main will contain the following:  
Test Data - a folder containing two .csv files, to be used accordingly to their file names in the Admin View upload window.  
CSI3450 - Presentation - Team Sort and Destroy.pdf - Our team’s presentation.  
ERDCreationScript.sql - The .sql file that creates the tables used in the database.  
ERDInitializationScript.sql - The .sql file that initializes all the tables with the data needed for them and the application to use.  
VideoGameDB_UI - A folder containing the entire project’s code. Contained in here is VideoGameDB_UI.sln, which will open the project’s code to then be run in Visual Studio 2019.   
To access the executable file, it can be accessed by proceeding through the bin folder, and then the Release folder. It will be in the Release folder named “VideoGameDB_UI.exe”.
